# Apocalipse Zumbi

## Description:
Apocalipse Zumbi is a 3D time-based Zombie shooter, made following the “Unity parte” courses from Alura. The game consists of the player having to survive for as long as possible against zombies constantly spawning, with the challenge increasing with boss zombies spawning every minute. To facilitate the challenge medkits are available for the player to pick up, to increase the odds of surviving long enough to beat their high score.
